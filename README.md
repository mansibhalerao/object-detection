# object-detection
This is a project to detect various objects from an image. <br>
-> It will create bounding boxes for all images along with the confidence values.
-> I Used yolo v3 object detector which is pretrained model on the coco dataset.YOLO v3 uses darknet neural network framework for training and testing convolutional neural network. <br>
-> Yolo goes through CNN in a single pass and hence is the fastest model,for object detection.
